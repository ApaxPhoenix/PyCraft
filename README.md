# Minecraft Clone in Python

This project is a Minecraft clone built using Python and the Pyglet library for rendering, as well as the PyOpenGL library for interfacing with OpenGL. The goal of the project is to create a lightweight and customizable alternative to Minecraft that can be easily extended with new features and mods.

## Features

The Minecraft clone currently includes the following features:

- Basic terrain generation with hills, trees, and caves
- First-person camera movement with WASD controls
- Block placement and removal with the mouse
- Day/night cycle with dynamic lighting

## Installation

To run the Minecraft clone, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the Pyglet and PyOpenGL libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pyglet pyopengl
   ```
3. Download the project files from [GitHub](https://github.com/username/minecraft-clone)
4. Run the `main.py` file in a terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Modding

The Minecraft clone is designed to be easily moddable. To create a mod, simply create a new Python file in the `mods` directory and add your code. You can use Pyglet and PyOpenGL to create custom blocks, items, and entities, as well as modify the game's behavior.
